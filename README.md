Java Multithreading Project
This project demonstrates various aspects of multithreading in Java. It includes examples of thread creation, synchronization, concurrency issues, and thread management.

Features
Basic Thread Operations: Examples of creating and running threads using Thread class and Runnable interface.
Thread Synchronization: Demonstrations of synchronization techniques to avoid concurrent modification issues.
Concurrency Utilities: Usage of Java Concurrency utilities from the java.util.concurrent package, including ExecutorService, CountDownLatch, and Semaphore.
Producer-Consumer Problem: Implementation of common concurrency problems and their solutions.
Deadlock Prevention: Examples and strategies for preventing deadlocks in multithreaded applications.# Multithreading-Programs

Technologies Used
Java 8 or higher

Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

Usage
Explore the Examples: Navigate to the src directory to explore various multithreading examples.

Examples
Thread Creation: Shows basic examples of creating and running threads using Thread and Runnable.
Thread Synchronization: Demonstrates synchronization using synchronized blocks and ReentrantLock.
Concurrency Utilities: Examples using ExecutorService, CountDownLatch, and Semaphore.
Producer-Consumer: Implementation of the producer-consumer problem with proper synchronization.
Deadlock: Examples illustrating deadlock scenarios and strategies for avoidance.
